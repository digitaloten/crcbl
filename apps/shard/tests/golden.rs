//! Shard's zone off a real device, from the fixed camera set, on every
//! [`GeometryPath`] this adapter can be held down to — against the checked-in
//! goldens.
//!
//! # What this is the exit criterion for
//!
//! `docs/plan/sample/15-shard.md`'s milestone 1 asks for "golden frames per
//! `GeometryPath` from a fixed camera set". This sample's whole subject is the
//! *fallback* paths carrying real content — a browser's frame goes through
//! `IndirectPerBatch`, `ArrayPages` and `LightingPath::Rasterised` by
//! construction — so a frame that is only ever checked on the tail a desktop
//! adapter selects for itself is a frame checked on the path nobody ships to.
//!
//! # The camera set is derived, not scripted
//!
//! [`crcbl_shard::Iso`] is a bearing and the bearing it is swinging toward, and
//! `Q`/`E` ask it for a quarter turn. A headless run receives no key, so the
//! binary can only ever present the spawn bearing — but the rig is a pure
//! function of that bearing and of where the character is standing, so the
//! other three bearings are *computed* here rather than pressed for:
//! [`station`] asks the sample's own [`Iso`] for `n` quarter turns and lets it
//! settle. The set is therefore the four bearings the sample can be in — named
//! below for the turn rather than for a compass direction, because the zone has
//! no north — drawn from the state [`Game::render_state`] reports before the
//! first tick has run.
//!
//! # A path is reached by subtracting features from one adapter
//!
//! `apps/quarry/tests/device/harness.rs`'s mechanism, and the reason it works:
//! [`GeometryPath::from_features`] reads `MESH_SHADER`, then
//! `DRAW_INDIRECT_COUNT`, and falls through to `IndirectPerBatch`, so
//! withholding one feature at a time from the device request walks down the
//! three. A device that never had the feature lands on the same path by the
//! same rule, which is what makes a forced path evidence about the path rather
//! than about this adapter.
//!
//! The subtraction starts from [`OffscreenSetup::OPTIONAL_FEATURES`] rather
//! than from a hand-written list, for `apps/lantern/tests/golden.rs`'s reason:
//! two arms opened from different bases are not a comparison, and a list
//! written out here would keep naming the old flags after the request grew one.
//! [`BASE`] is that request with one further flag off, for a reason that is
//! about the two rasterisers rather than about this sample — see it.
//!
//! **An adapter that cannot reach a path says so and does not compare.** No
//! frame is skipped quietly: the test prints which path it asked for, which one
//! the device opened on and what the adapter offers, and
//! `tests/run-shard-golden.sh` refuses a run in which *nothing* matched.
//!
//! # One reference per bearing, not one per path
//!
//! Three paths share each bearing's golden, which is
//! `apps/lantern/tests/golden.rs`'s argument rather than
//! `apps/quarry/tests/device/goldens.rs`': a lesser geometry path is a
//! constraint on how the submission tail is built and not a separate renderer,
//! so a difference between two paths is a **bug**, and a second reference would
//! bless it. Quarry commits one image per path because its paths genuinely
//! disagree — at its mixing budget the mesh path draws two levels per cluster
//! where the others select one per instance — and this zone has no such
//! hierarchy: it is one authored table of greybox pieces, drawn identically by
//! all three tails. Measured, not assumed: every path matches the same
//! reference inside [`Tolerance::RASTERISER`] on radv and on lavapipe.
//!
//! # A golden alone cannot say the frame is right
//!
//! Two black frames compare perfectly. So the golden is the *last* assertion
//! and the ones in front of it are about **where** the frame is bright — the
//! figure standing in the middle of it, the floor the torches light beside it,
//! and how many colours a torch-lit interior has at all.
//!
//! [`the_torches_are_what_lights_the_zone`] carries the claim no single frame
//! can: the same bearing drawn with the torches doused, which is the one switch
//! `L` gives a player and the one the browser gate reads.
//!
//! # Feature-gated *and* ignored
//!
//! The pair `crcbl`'s `render-e2e`, lantern's and quarry's suites use. A plain
//! `cargo test --workspace --all-features` on a machine with no GPU must stay
//! green, and `tests/run-shard-golden.sh` is the only thing that turns both off
//! — and it fails when the suite reports zero tests run.
