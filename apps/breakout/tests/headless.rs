//! Breakout as CI runs it: the real binary, no display, deterministic.
//!
//! `apps/breakout/src/app.rs` and `src/game.rs` unit-test the loop and the
//! simulation directly. This file tests the *deliverable* — the compiled
//! binary, its arguments and its exit codes — for the same reason
//! `apps/sandbox/tests/headless.rs` exists: that is what
//! `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and a developer both actually invoke.
//!
//! Breakout had neither this file nor a CI job of its own, so nothing outside
//! the crate's own unit tests ever ran the first playable sample.
//!
//! Everything here runs on Linux, macOS and Windows with no window system
//! present.
